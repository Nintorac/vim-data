A dataset containing input output pairs of string as well as the vim transformation that goes alongside them. 


Here is some example schema of an initial dataset that I would like to build. 
eg. 

| source           | target           | transform                          |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
|                  | hello world      | ihello world{i}\033:wq\n           |
| hello world      | hello geezer     | fwc$geezer\033:wq\n                |
| hello            | hello, world!    | A, world!{esc}                     |
| good morning     | good evening     | ct evening{esc}                    |
| remove me        | remove           | $F d{esc}                          |
| start end        | start and end    | eand {esc}                         |
| unix             | UNIX             | gUiw                               |
    
    : **all but the initial two of these were generated by GPT-4
